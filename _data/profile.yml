    With over 7 years of graduate academic experience, I am passionate about pavement and geotechnical engineering, 
    focusing on analyzing and designing pavements and roadways, as well as conducting high-level network analysis for 
    pavement management. My research focuses on the effects of climate change on pavement performance and pavement 
    structural analysis and design, where my findings published in prestigious conferences and journals such as the 
    Transportation Research Board (TRB), International Journal of Pavement Engineering (IJPE), and Construction and Building Materials (CBM), etc.

    I have developed advanced programming skills to create practical tools and programs that facilitate industry-level 
    analyses. Throughout my academic journey, I have gained extensive experience in material testing, teamwork, and 
    leadership. I will complete my Ph.D. at Michigan State University in December 2024. Additionally, I hold a Master's 
    degree in road and transportation engineering and a Bachelor's degree in civil engineering, both from Sharif 
    University of Technology. I have received multiple honors for my academic excellence.

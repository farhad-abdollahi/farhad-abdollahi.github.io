  Construction, operation, and maintenance of a pavement network requires funding, partially sourced from road user taxes. Recent studies showed that lightweight vehicles are typically taxed higher compared with heavy trucks that damage the roads the most. To facilitate the equity and fairness of the allocated costs to different vehicles in the United States (U.S.), Highway Cost Allocation Studies (HCAS) were performed using various pavement performance prediction models. Reviewed literature showed the lack of mechanistic-empirical (ME)-based HCAS models for the flexible pavement network. In this study, a national-level ME-based HCAS model was developed, and the damage shares of different vehicle classes have been estimated for 67,583 pavement sections in the U.S. Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) database. The proposed HCAS model was compared with the existing Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) HCAS model (i.e., National Pavement Cost Model [NAPCOM]). The analysis of the traffic data showed that two-axle single-unit trucks (SU2) and tractor-semitrailers with two tandem and one single axle (CS5T) were the most frequent users of the pavement network. The results showed that the damage share of SU2 is dominant in minor roadways, while the damage share of the heavier vehicles in the CS5T class is dominant in major arterials and interstates. In addition, it was found that, although the geographical location and environmental condition of the pavement section affects the magnitude of the pavement distresses, the distribution of the damage shares remains almost the same. This can be attributed to the similarities in the traffic data, for example, vehicle class distribution and axle load spectra.

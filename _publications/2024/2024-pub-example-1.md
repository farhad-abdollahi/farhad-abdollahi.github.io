  The resilient modulus (MR) and the backcalculated modulus from the FWD testing (EFWD) of the unbound layers are critical inputs in the analysis/design of pavements. Several studies have tried to develop a conversion factor between these two parameters, while the nonlinear stress dependency of unbound materials and the pavement strain response are mostly missing from the literature. This study aims to compare the laboratory-measured MR of recycled aggregate base (RAB) materials and a virgin aggregate base using field-based EFWD and tries to establish pavementâ€™s responses to loading using vertical strains from both the MR and EFWD values of the respective materials as comparability parameters between the two. For this purpose, a control virgin aggregate (VA, limestone) and three types of RAB materials were selected to construct four test sections. The test sections were modeled in layered elastic- and finite-element-based pavement response models to calculate the vertical strains at the mid-depth of the base and top of the subgrade layers. A comparison of the lab-calculated vertical strains using MR with actual vertical strains in the field from EFWD showed that there was no relationship between the two stiffness parameters in all tested RABs. The vertical strains, based on the lab MR, undermined the stiffness of the recycled aggregates in the field. In contrast, the values of EFWD based on the vertical strains remained close to the MR strains of limestone (VA) throughout the testing period, establishing an EFWD vs. MR relationship (MR = 0.87 EFWD). The results also show that fine RCA was a better-performing material over three years. This research not only explores how the hydration process in RABs limits the development of MR-EFWD correlations but also underscores the need to consider real-world conditions when assessing their performance.
